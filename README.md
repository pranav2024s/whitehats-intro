## Why I want to join WhiteHats  
I want to join WhiteHats because I am interested in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and learning how to protect systems from cyber threats. I believe WhiteHats will help me grow technically and work with like-minded people.  

## Recent Cybersecurity Incident I Read About  
Recently, I read about a ransomware attack on a major hospital where attackers locked critical medical data and demanded payment. This incident showed how dangerous cyber threats can be and why cybersecurity is important.
